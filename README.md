## Detecting Regime of markets

#### Gausian Mixture Model
Use Gausian mixture model and Hidden Markov model to catch regime shift of the market. Multiple asset classes such as stock, bond, real estate and commodity are used to detect regime shift.   
Original idea from Alex Botte and Doris Bao from Two Sigma. Original article can be found in below link.

#### Greedy Gausian Segmentation
Use Greedy Gausian Segmentation model to catch regime shift of market. Single asset class (US Equity) is used to detect regime shift.  
Original idea from David Hallac, Peter Nystrup, Stephen Boyd of Stanford University.
